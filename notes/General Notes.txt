Spent a long time troubleshooting an issue with the menu not showing up for the admin user (Drupal uid = 1).
It turned out the culprit was using drush sqlsan to sanitize emails and passwords.  This caused a mismatch when 
civicrm tries to match with the Drupal uid (I believe the email field caused this).  This then resulted in no
contactid matching when doing a session lookup.  For some reason this allowed normal administrative tasks, but
no administrative menu.  This was discussed with little help on IRC.  No troubleshooting documentation was provided online
by me, though given Civi's extremely poor online documenation when it comes to troubleshooting, it would be nice.
