Spent a long time troubleshooting an issue with the menu not showing up for the admin user (Drupal uid = 1).
It turned out the culprit was using drush sqlsan to sanitize emails and passwords.  This caused a mismatch when 
civicrm tries to match with the Drupal uid (I believe the email field caused this).  This then resulted in no
contactid matching when doing a session lookup.  For some reason this allowed normal administrative tasks, but
no administrative menu.  This was discussed with little help on IRC.  No troubleshooting documentation was provided online
by me, though given Civi's extremely poor online documenation when it comes to troubleshooting, it would be nice.

After lots of email issues sending straight through PHP mail function, we explored Amazon SES.  It had it's own issues
with receiving emails too rapidly from CiviCRM such that they would bounce.  After lots of Googlage:
http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php/topic,18279.15.html?PHPSESSID=5h4scpuigv292nvp5buev2a0k6 (second page of forum thread)

That links to a Mandrill extension that can be incorporated into CiviCRM: 
http://civicrm.org/extensions/mandrill-transactional-emails/mandrill-transactional-emails
Github: https://github.com/JMAConsulting/biz.jmaconsulting.mte/blob/master/README.md

As of today, I did not currently install that package, but rather just set up the SMTP to go through Mandrill.  Adam Haile, who
still is managing the durhambicyclecoalition.org DNS set up the DKIM but was unable to set up SPF records on namecheap for 
verification of sending.

I began working through how the bike buddy system might work.  I started to look at other nice mapping sites that help with tracking
paths and such.  What first came to mind was mapmyride.com.  I realized they had an API, so the current plan is to have folks create
maps via mapmyride, since there are lots of really nice features that would take a long time to replicate.  We can then use the api
to pull in those maps as gpx, or images, or other details that will help.  The api is pretty poorly documented, so I sent an email
to the mapmyride api department to help with the route retrieval as it was not working on first test.

I got an email from api support last night saying that documentation and api methods are being rapidly developed.  The get_gpx method 
is only available to a privilged few for the time being.  I was recommended to use the get_route method.  I found success with that. 
http://api.mapmyfitness.com/3.1/routes/get_route?&o=xml&r=&route_key=&route_id=167477260&created_date=&activity_type=&old_json=&loc=

Next step is to build out the infrastructure in Drupal, and do a proof of concept that we can import and display the data based
on route id or key that should be easily discoverable by anyone creating a route.
